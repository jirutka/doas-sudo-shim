== NAME

sudo - execute a command as another user using doas


== SYNOPSIS

*sudo* (-i | -s) [-n] [-u <__user__>] [<__command__> [--] [<__args__>...]] +
*sudo* [-ins] [-u <__user__>] <__command__> [--] [<__args__>...] +
*sudo* [-h]


== DESCRIPTION

This is not the original {sudo}, but a shim for the `sudo` command that utilizes {doas}.
It supports only a subset of the {sudo} options that have an equivalent in {doas}, plus option *-i* (*--login*).
Long options are supported.

See {doas} and {sudo} for more information.


== OPTIONS

*-i*, *--login*::
Run the shell specified by the target __user__`'s password database entry as a login shell.
This means that login-specific resource files such as `.profile`, `.bash_profile` or `.login` will be read by the shell.
If a _command_ is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution via the shell`'s *-c* option.
If no _command_ is specified, an interactive shell is executed.
This shim attempts to change to that __user__`'s home directory right after running the shell.

*-n*, *--non-interactive*::
Non interactive mode, fail if the matching rule doesn`'t have the `nopass` option.

*-s*, *--shell*::
Run the shell specified by the `SHELL` environment variable if it is set or the shell specified by the invoking user`'s password database entry.
If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution via the shell`'s *-c* option.
If no command is specified, an interactive shell is executed.
Note that most shells behave differently when a command is specified as compared to an interactive session; consult the shell`'s manual for details.

*-u* <__user__>, *--user* <__user__>::
Run the _command_ as a _user_, other than the default target user (usually `root`).
The user may be either a user name or a numeric user-ID (UID).
Unlike in the original {sudo}, numeric UIDs does not have to be prefixed with the '`#`' character and only UIDs listed in the password database are allowed.

*-h*, *--help*::
Print help message and exit.


== FILES

Refer to {doas}.


== ENVIRONMENT

This shim sets the following environment variables for compatibility with {sudo}.
However, they must be explicitly allowed in {doas-conf} (using `setenv` or `keepenv`) to be exported into the created environment.

*SUDO_GID*::
Set to the group-ID of the user who invoked *sudo*.

*SUDO_UID*::
Set to the user-ID of the user who invoked *sudo*.

*SUDO_USER*::
Set to the login name of the user who invoked *sudo*.
